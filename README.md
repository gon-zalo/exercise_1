This class project examined Zipf's Abbreviation Law (which says that words which occur more frequently tend to be shorter, while less frequent words are generally longer) in Polish and English rap lyrics. The repository contains the main code which scrapes all the lyrics (around 1500 songs), then processes it with Regular Expressions and tokenizes it using SpaCy. Afterwards it calculates Zipf's law and shows a plot (also included in the repository).
