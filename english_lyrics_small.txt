Just the two of us.. (8X)

[Eminem]
Baby your da-da loves you (hey)
And I'ma always be here for you (hey) no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's takin a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell (whew!) da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
that do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was eatin
dinner while you were sweepin and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
and me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us.. (2X)
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. (2X)
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. (2X)
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. (2X)
Just you and I!

See honey.. there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad
She was bein mean to dad and made him real real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out (WAHH!)
I told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba-ba? 
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make goo-goo ca-ca? Da-da change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
Ninety-seven Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Just the two of us.. (2X)
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. (2X)
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. (2X)
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. (2X)
Just you and I!

Wake up sweepy head we're here, before we pway
we're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin in her ear (ma-maa!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free..
One.. two.. free.. WHEEEEEE! (whoooooshhhhh)
There goes mama, spwashin in the wa-ta
No more fightin wit dad, no more restraining order
No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her (mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

Just the two of us.. (2X)
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. (2X)
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. (2X)
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. (2X)
Just you and I!

Just the two of us.. (4X)

[Eminem]
Just me and you baby
is all we need in this world
Just me and you
Your da-da will always be there for you
Your da-da's always gonna love you
Remember that
If you ever need me I will always be here for you
If you ever need anything, just ASK
Da-da will be right there
Your da-da loves you
I love you babyft Tupac


(Part 1: Tupac)
Sometimes its hard, to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons, I dont wanna hear 'em anymore
Got me heartbroken, fine, So many babies screamin
Cuz they seeing destruction before they see a human being
So they start smokin weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families safe
Cuz they all broken, why? Two ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly
Somebody else can say im pokin guns, smokin weed
Can all make the change so im told but i havent seen a change unfold
I keep hopin, please! If you prefer to breath
Communities in need, of people that we lead
Keep your eyes open now, then only say I try
Until the day I die, I promised to be wise
With my heart open, greed, brings only misery
A weight of tragedy, so I stay sucker free
Only a few chosen rise, my ghetto queens rise
Dont be afraid to try, too many of us die
For the thought of hopen wise, my brothers speak wise
They focus on the prize, till everybody dies

(Part 2: Eminem)
We could only learn to take, our anger and our hate
Control our mental state, settle down and just set it straight
Maybe we could learn to take, a second to pump the brakes
But we said it, regret it later, and let it escalade
Cuz by then its just too late, theres so much we can take
Theres only so much someone can swallow and tolerate
Till the point that he just breaks, snaps and thats all it takes
You think that we was learnin from other rappers mistakes
But we aint, his brain will go against
With every artist comes an image he portrays
And a picture that he paints
But in the midst of all this anger and this gangs
Never once did you hear me say I'm a gangsta
And I aint hear no complaints
But I know, that I will always continue to grow
As long as I lead, and never follow noone else's shadow
There will never be another me, and that I will guarantee
Its that why I remain sucker free, to this day
The game, will never be the same
No matter how much fame or success they attain
There will never be another me
And no matter what they do, there will never be another you
You can search but you'll never find
You can try to rewind time, but in your hearts and your minds
We will never die, we are forever alive
When we continue going, one day at a time

(Part 3: Outlawz #1)
Dont get caught in the publicity, and caught in the hype
Rappers are, regular people minus money and lights
Searchin for, fortune and fame and super stardom
All the jewelry, all the cars, who screws the hardest
Now the Hip Hop Police's surveillance is watchin
And the kids think beef is their only option
Outlawz, poor and filthy, guilty as charged
My memories they can die, my -Makaveli- lives on
You think the industry is fun, and no pity with guns
And when your money is up, thats when your enemies come
So if he died and came back, would he try to save rap
We needin a change, the drama remains


(Part 4: Outlawz #2)
I spend my whole life,(yeah) fightin myself
That, I cant win, so I'm invitin some help
And every now and then, I take rights on the left
I'm still just like a kid, lookin for stripes on my belt
That day is a fight in itself
So I just pray and hope God take a light to myself
No matter how much I try to stay alive, I'mma die, mad
Still standin and in love with my pride

(Part 5: Outlawz #3)
My hard frivilous beef, we passed that
Im tryna keep some in c-comin and then collect on my ass cap
But rappers in the game aint changed
And I finally realized that we not in the same game
The hatin will never end, so I guess I'll deal with it
Them 4-5 a cop, chillers just I'm still with it
Them streets is military, you gotta be a soldier
Gotta stay lirry and keep your eyes on the Rollers
They do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us
So we gotta do it, we gotta do to keep growin
One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind
When we continue growin, one day at a time (Damn!)(Royce da 5’9″)
Ryan’s a homicidal misfit
I write the solution to biophysics
On the side of a cliff in some hieroglyphics
This my mission of having violent psychotic
Quick devour polish it, politics
By the way I’m higher than the Eiffel Tower tip
I like writin’, but I will stick this pencil your ass before I bite your shit
Pause, inhalin’ hella kusha
Us and Yelawolf like a heavy foot gas pedal push
Felons, crooks, goin’ door-to-door like we sellin’ books
Dolly Parton style, melons mushed
Now my bitch a dancer, I’m ’bout as sick as cancer
If you could swallow my style, you’d prob’ly rip your pants off
If you could bottle my style and sell it to somebody
It prob’ly’ll smell like cologne made out of bits of panther
They call me Anchorman, I hold down the ship
Leave you ***** floatin’ in water, then go and drown a fish
Fuck, I’m fuckin’ heinous, I make you fuckin’ famous
Them lead showers is comin’, fuck is you sayin’?

(Eminem)
Fuck, it’s fuckin’ rainin’! Shit, there’s lightning!
Bitch, it’s thunderin’, ’cause I’m hustlin’ up a storm if you wonderin’
Shit (Shit), you couldn’t muster up enough thought
To take a dump during a brain fart, jump if you want
Urine in your face, all you had to do was say
That you wish you would’ve just stayed pissed off in the first place
We came to monopolize the game, Illuminati is here
Yeah, human oddities, at odds with us, your squad’s gotta be
‘Cause we started out cold in a snowball, we froze
Soon as we rolled up on these hoes, all’s we know
Is y’all lowered like bar like limbo, you know who you are
So quit fuckin’ the dog ‘fore we start callin’ you bizarre
Shit, screw the pooch? Y’all done raped a pit bull
Fell in love with the shih-tzu, this missile’s directed directly at you
And this for these hoes who don’t know me from a can of paint
You must be huffin’, fuck a ballsack, if the taints cain’t
Take you on a date, you mistake me for a gentleman
You 2000 and late, man, and Will I ain’t, I’m the bad guy
Type of guy that’ll drag five girls up on stage
Pour ice in their pants, and the first one who pees gets a black eye

(Eminem)
Must be outta your mind, you think you fuckin’ with us
Suck on these nuts, bitch, hang it up, this game is over

(Joell Ortiz)
Puffin’ loosies, watchin’ I Love Lucy with Gary Busey
(Crazy!) How the fuck could you son me? (I’m Shady!)
Will there ever come a day when they could slay me?
I don’t know, fifth month, black and yellow insect, maybe
‘Til then I kill the bad man tryna slay me
Everything you kick weak, your spit kung fugazi (Hi-ya!)
All my homeboys, 2.0 Boys
Nickle, I just picked up a Phantom, look how it rolls, Royce!
Even if I wanted to quit, I ain’t got no choice
Verses keep comin’, I should invoice my own voice
You should see the kind of asses that my pole hoist
Hoes be like diamonds in your chain, man, so moist
Bang bang, bang bang, House Gang, chainsaw
Here to kill you pussies, don’t ask what we came for
I write ’til my right arm veins sore
Forearm feel like Thor’s arm in a gang war
You hear that (YAOWA), you know who finna file out
Definitively finish you, my fist stick out that eyeball
Piranha mentality wit’ a Jaws bite all night
Comin’ up, never saw light, but never lost sight

(Joe Budden)
Jets and movers, cesspoolers, meth abusers
You step to us, text Rugers to respect the shooters
My men think in sync, roll with the best crew
Move to the beat of the same drum without Lex Luger
Welcome to Nayhood, big in the ‘jects, G
Cheated death multiple times without riggin’ the deck
So I’m well-prepped if you just want war
There’ll be blood everywhere, you be layin’ on the Louboutin floor
It’s raw, you keepin’ actin’ like you don’t know Mouse, *****
And you gon’ need the best doctors, House, *****
Guard your jewels and avoid large tools
‘Cause after I spill you at the light, you be in a car pool
Keep your distance from idiots, ’cause the truth told
They food for thought’s rotten, they gems are fool’s gold
Need results from my actions, mistakes I’ll exonerate
I’m Martin King starin’ at a picture of Obama’s face
Talkin’ funds, ***** ain’t never seen stock
I don’t need the key to the game, I pick a mean lock

Must be outta your mind, you think you fuckin’ with us
Suck on these nuts, bitch, hang it up, this game is over

(Crooked I)
Takeoff
You invited inside of the mind of
A psychotic rhymer, I’m kind of a (Dahmer!), I’m grindin’
Now rappers are linin’ up jackers, I’m climbin’ up ladders
I buy enough clappers to retire you factors, fire at drama
You liars and actors, I’m the genuine article
But read me wrong, get my gun and split you to particles
(The gold hand) Tell me when and I’m there
Not only heir to the throne, but my chair is suspended in air
Stay fly like a limited fare
You got us pegged wrong, my circle don’t fit in with squares
I smell shit and piss, know where it’s comin’ from
You stepped on number two just to be number one
Now I’ma step on you, bring it to yo’ yard
Bogart for arts, we go hard
You frauds just blow hard like broads, I coast guard the west
I’m Mozart, I compose dark shit with no heart

(Yelawolf)
I got no Jim Beam in the liver
Gettin’ head like clean clippers, wit’ haters on my dick like a jeans zipper
When I throw up 16s like I drink liqour
You think you seen sick? Well, bitch, you ain’t seen sicker
Then I’ll crack, and then I’ll hop around in a hospital gown
Poppin’ the trunk, my pumper stay cockin’ the round
I shit logs and I piss river brown
‘Cause I drink creek water and spit the river Nile
And that’s as close as I get to a pyramid
Shit, they think I’m Illuminati, so fuckin’ ignorant
Sick with a grin, here with this pen, so innocent
But when you win, they say you a sin, but in the end
They jump on the bandwagon and dance to the band playin’
Skinny-ass pants saggin’, it’s only yourself you playin’
Call me a clown, but you love where the clown’s hangin’
And the freakshow’s at the county carnival, then you payin’
Bitch, I’m on a trapeze with no legs in the dark
Yellin’ “Go Shady!” Drivin’ slower than an old lady
In an old ’89, no piece if you pay me
Gimme peace sign on my grill, no Mercedes
I’m gettin’ paid for these shows that I throw lately
Same shows a year ago woulda broken most of you crazies
They call me crazy ’cause I made it
Bitch, you crazy ’cause you quit, look at my clique lately
You ain’t fuckin’ wit’ Budden, you ain’t got no choice with Royce
You don’t wanna see the Crooked I, well, listen to Ortiz voice
That dirt road hit the 8 Mile, the Porno Boys
And if Marshall want me to clap, then, homie, I deploy
Game over
(Yo, I don’t think they heard you, tell ‘em again)
Game over[intro]
too late for the other side
caught in a chase
25 to life
too late for the other side
caught in a chase
25 to life
yeah
too late
i can't keep chasing em
taking my life back
caught in a chase
25 to life

[verse 1]

I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I made
maybe if this bitch had acted right I would’ve stayed
but i've already wasted over half of my life
I would’ve laid down and died for you
I no longer cry for you
no more pain bitch you
took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
into the dirt I can no longer stand it
now my respect I demand it
i'm a take control of this relationship
command it, and imma be the boss of you now goddamnit
and what i mean is that I will no longer let you control me
so you better hear me out this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you, why I’ve stayed?
faithful all the way, this is how I fucking get repaid
look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess
always in a rush to get back to you I ain't heard you yet
not even once say you apreciate me i deserve respect
i've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
and i know that if I end this I’ll no longer have nothing left
but you keep treating me like a staircase it's time to fucking step
and i won't be coming back so don't hold your fucking breath
you know what you've done no need to go in depth
i told you, you'd be sorry if i fucking left
i'd laugh while you wept
how's it feel now, yeah, funny ain't it, you neglected me
did me a favor though my spirit free you've said
but a special place for you in my heart i have kept
it's unfortunate but it's,

[chorus]
Too late for the other side
caught in a chase
25 to life
too late for the other side
caught in a chase
25 to life

[verse 2]

i feel like when i bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
cause that ain't good enough you expect me to fold myself in half
til i snap
don't think i'm loyal
all i do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side
i have no life outside of that
don't i give you enough of my time
you don't think so do you
jealous when i spend time with the girls
why i'm married to you still man i don't know
but tonight i'm serving you with papers
i'm divoricing you
go marry someone else and make em famous
and take away there freedom like you did to me
treat em like you don't need them and they ain't worthy of you
feed em the same shit that you made me eat
i'm moving on forget you oh,
now i'm special, I ain't feel special when i was with you
all i ever felt was this
helplessness
imprisoned by a selfish bitch
chew me up and spit me out
i fell for this so many times
it's ridiculus
and still i stick with this
i'm sick of this, but in my sickness, an addiction
your as addictive as they get
they get evil as they come
vindictive as they make em
my friends keep asking me why i cant just walk away from em.
I'm addicted to the pain, the stress, the drama
i'm drawn to, shit i guess i'm a mess
cursed and blessed
but this time i'm a
ain't changing my mind
i'm climbing out this abyss
you screaming as I walk out that I’ll be missed
but when you spoke of people who meant the most to you
you left me off your list
fuck you hip-hop
i'm leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch
and it's just

[chorus]
too late for the other side
caught in a chase
25 to life
too late for the other side
caught in a chase
25 to life
too late
caught in a chase
25 to life
[End][Intro]
There is no escaping, there's no place to hide

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Just sit there and act pathetic and sulk
'Cause I'm getting green, Incredible Hulk
'Cause I usually get it in bulk
But I still will stomp your head to a pulp (Yeah)
You want smoke, I got the tical like Method Man
So get ready to die from second hand
Get a whiff of the doctor's medicine
Like sedatives you'll get popped, Excedrin
'Cause you can get it like over the counter (Yo)
Like I just left the damn concession stand (Yeah)
A mic in my hand's a weapon (What?)
I put that on everything like ranch, I'll never land
Too fly, I don't plan to ever Cinderella Man
What I am is better than
Every single one of you
Whether separate or all of you band together
And I put the game on the pill (Yeah)
Now my Shady babies are all stillborns
Meaning abortions that live 'cause they were still born
I can heal 'em with Neosporin
You 'bout to experience euphoria
(I'm a) true warrior, got the plug like Trugoy
Give me the cue like I'm ScHoolboy
And I'll treat the beat like a pitbull would do to a chew toy and destroy it, 'cause boy I-

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I almost lost it
I had to reach back, back, and lock it, yeah (Lock it, lock it)
You almost got me (Stop it, stop it)
I had to reach back, back, and lock it, yeah (Lock it, lock it)
You almost (Stop it), you almost (Stop it), you almost (Stop it), but I got it (I got it)
You almost (Stop it), you almost (Stop it), you almost (Stop it), I got it (I got it)[Eminem]
Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted-One moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs,
But he keeps on forgettin what he wrote down,
The whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking now, everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up over, bloah!
Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that
Easy, no
He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke
He's so stagnant that he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo
This this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't

[Amy Lee]
My God my tourniquet
Return to me salvation
My God my tourniquet
Return to me salvation 

[Eminem]
The soul's escaping, through this hole that it's gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's know as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
His hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it's old partner but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum

[Amy Lee]
My God my tourniquet
Return to me salvation
My God my tourniquet
Return to me salvation 

[Eminem]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfucking roof off like 2 dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhyming and stepwritin the next cypher
Best believe somebody's paying the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
Cause man, these goddam food stamps don't buy diapers
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
Trying to feed and water my seed, plus
Teeter totter caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama's screaming on and
Too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail
I've got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfucking option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go is my shot.
Feet fail me not cause maybe the only opportunity that I got

[Amy Lee]
My wounds cry for the grave
My soul cries for deliverance
Will I be denied Christ
Tourniquet
My suicide...Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?


Yo,
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already: Mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!
Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity, oh
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad, but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo! This whole rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him


You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo x2
You better…


His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther
From home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, ‘cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah


You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo x2 
You better…


No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's paying the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five, and I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family ‘cause, man, these goddamn
Food stamps don't buy diapers, and there's no movie
There's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed; plus, teeter-totter
Caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screaming on her
Too much for me to wanna stay in one spot
Another day of monotony's gotten me to the point
I'm like a snail, I've got to formulate a plot
Or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option—failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet: fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got


You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo x2 
You better…Yo, if you could just, for one minute
Or one split second in time, forget everything
Everything that bothers you, all your problems
Everything, and follow me

If I was frozen inside of a moment
If I could capture time inside a capsule
An hourglass full of sand in the palm of my hand, it passes through it
If I can grasp it, and just control what happens to it
Then I can trap it, so no more time elapses through it
If raps could do it, maybe I could tap into it
Then I could try to channel it through Cadillacs and Buicks
To transmit through 'em, to make you put your ass into it
And that's when you hit the roof because you can't sit through it
Your passions too much for you to not be dancing to it
And as you do it, your movements become fast and fluent
You're mashin' to it, moshing until you're black and bluish
You're acting foolish, this music it has influenced you to be rowdy but in an orderly fashion
True it's chaotic, but it's got your body moving as a unit
Uniting together tonight, so make it last and you better just

Lose yourself in this music
This moment we own it, we won't never let it go (go)
You better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time, to sit there and procrastinate (you better)
Lose yourself in this music
This moment we own it, we won't never let it go (go)
You better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time, to sit there and procrastinate (you better)

Cause when we descend together, we begin to move as one
In perfect unison just like the moon and sun
Illuminate the room and humans soon become aluminum
Rhythmically in sync, if you'll excuse the pun
But if you could lose it once, I mean if you could let shit go
Relax, take a breath, and just let it exit slow
To rest your soul, you could leave the rest to me
If I could give the world a hit of ecstasy
To make 'em feel the feeling that I'm feeling right this minute
Cause I feel like the night won't end til I get finished
So close the shades, makin' sure no light gets in it
The sky's the limit tonight because the night's infinite
A high percentage of black people and white mixed in it
But no one really gives a fuck cause they just like what's spinnin'
His life was spinnin', the whole entire night just spinnin'
Like life's beginning, so come out from inside your skin and quit hidin' in it

Lose yourself in this music
This moment we own it, we won't never let it go (go)
You better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time, to sit there and procrastinate (you better)
Lose yourself in this music
This moment we own it, we won't never let it go (go)
You better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time, to sit there and procrastinate (you better)(Crowd singing in bar in the background)
I never meant too... give you mushrooms girl...
I never meant to.... Bring you to my world...
And now you're lying, in the corner... cryyaaaing.
(yeah!, woohoo!)[Verse 1: Eminem]

Somethin's burnin', I can't figure out what (Out what)
It's either lust or a cloud of dust
Judgement is clouded, must just be the powder from the power of (Love!)
But I'm in somethin' I don't know how to get out of
Left my girl in the house alone
Is that my soon-to-be-spouse’s moan?
And the further I walked, the louder
Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard
'Cause after all, this is her place
So I give her the benefit of the doubt
I think I might be about to bust her, bust her
The thought's scary, yo though and it hurts - brace!
Hope it ain't, "here we go, yo!"
'Cause my head already goes to worst-case scenario, though, in the first place
But you confirmed my low-end theory, though
Should've known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date, could've made it to home plate
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face first
"No, (*slurp*) you don't (*slurp*) under- (*slurp*) -stand, 
(*slurp*) I (*slurp*) don't (*slurp*) do this for (*slurp*) anyone (*slurp*) ever (*slurp*)"
Yeah that ain't what they all say?
I'll say it, you can suck a softball through a straw, used to be my fiance
'Til you sucked on Wayne, Andre, and Kanye
Lebron, Akon, Jay, Lil Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e
Polow Tha Don, Drake, Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwame?!
Guess I'm gettin my goddamn Jigga on, eh?
'Cause your name, I'm beyond sayin'
But fuck it, I'm movin' on, you women are all cray
But I'll probably always keep on playin' the-

[Bridge: Sample]

Game of love, love, love, love
L-l, l-l-l-love

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]

She doesn't love me, no she don't love me no more
She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head as my bags hit the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before

And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do. I don't care!"
And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do. I don't care!"

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]

I told that bitch
"I'm a sucker for love, you're a sucker for dick"
Suckin' dick in your mama's tub 'til your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water, he drowned
Like an abortion, they booked you for manslaughter
You beat the case and I called ya
"Sherane is not available now leave a message at the tone
And Kendrick, don't forget to buy two pair of those
Expensive heels, you little fuckin' Ferris wheel
Fuckin' spinnin' on me - fuck you think, we gon' get married still?
Fuckin' Mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale
Fairy godmama better tell you how I fuckin' feel
Like you should fuckin' beat it or fuckin' eat it while I'm on my period
Now have a blessed day!"
Bitch you serious? I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
Why you ain't fuckin' with me, you cut me up, a Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the dillinger hit'em diligently and killin' him
His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for ya
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore ya
This is me talkin' cordial, yeah I got some home trainin'
That ain't what you like, ain't it? 
What about if I was famous as Marshall?
Would you give fellatio in the carpool?
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle
Singin', "I hope she's good enough
Meanwhile you're chasin' her"
Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
Pity the fool and pity the fool in me, I'ma live with her-

[Bridge: Sample]

Game of love, love, love, love
L-l, l-l-l-love

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]

She doesn't love me, no she don't love me no more
She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head as my bags hit the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before

And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do. I don't care!"
And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do. I don't care!"

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So needless to say I'm feeling betrayed
Snatch my house key off her key chain
She jumped off Wee-Bey from The Wire's dick
Now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record cliché, it's all my fault anyway
She's turnin' the tables, I'm a beat-break
She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ
Each day is an instant replay
They say what we display symptomatic of addict behavior
Back together but forgot today was her B-day, she cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstandin' but just as I went to slam on the brakes
That's when I realized that she may be as crazy as me, wait
Bitch cut my fuckin' brakeline, stepped on them fuckers 8 times
Still goin' 73, thank God there's an exit coming up
What the mother-F-U-C-K's wrong with her?
Hit the off ramp 'til I coasted to a goshdamn halt 
hit a fuckin' tree now here she comes at full speed, 
she's racin' at me, okay you wanna fuck with me, eh?
Snatch the bitch out her car through the window, she screamin'
I body slam her on the cement, until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
Buried the stink ho in it, then paid to have the street repaved
Woke up in a dream state in a cold sweat
Like I got hit with a freeze ray durin' a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though, 'cause she's layin' next to me in bed
Directly aimin' a gat at my head
Woke up again and jumped up like, "fuck it! I've had it, I'm checkin' into rehab"
I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy
Every girl I've ever had either says I got to much baggage
Or I'm too fuckin' dramatic
Man what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fucking romantic
I fuckin' love you, you fuckin' bitch!
Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic event
I said, "hit the road", and after she left
I sent that bitch a text that said, "be careful driving
Don't read this and have a accident"
She glanced to look at it and wrecked, too bad
Thought we had a connect
No sense dwelling makes, never been a more compelling case
Than a model covered in L'Oreal and mace, who fell from grace
Eleven stories for storytelling while the whore was yelling, "rape!"
'Til her vocal cords were swelling
And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spelling's face
Still they swarm the gates of my fancy estates
To greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
Unless you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date though, don't be late
Well the sentiment's great, but wait, then there's been a mistake
You want an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood, it's mainly because of the game of-
(*Message sound*)
Wait, "dinner at eight"?
I have infinite hate in my blood, it's mainly 'cause of the-

[Outro]

Game of love, love, love, love
L-l, l-l-l-love[Verse 1] 
 [Obie Trice] 
 You don't see me in the hood 
 It's cause I'm doing this man 

 Niggas, I'm still grinding, (yeah...) 
 I'm still hearing those sirens, 
 I'm still getting chased by those lights, 
 Only the light's mine and my mic's on 
 And my time is none because I'm writing more, 
 And I ain't here to meet a soul in this buisness, 
 I'm here to eat, speak, until these hoes feel this, (for sure...) 
 and I can't let y'all derail me man, 
 I got young Kobe, homie, you gotta let go of Obie 
 cause Obie be back, (ain't goin' nowhere man...) 
 We got them craps going on 
 and that yak going on, 
 soon as a nigga touch down back from tourin', 
 It's whateva, put that on the chedda man, 
 but in the meantime, it's Jimmy Ivene time, 
 chase cheese, rhyme till my voice give out, 
 this is it my nigga, this what we boast about, 
 Now I'm here so shut your motherfuckin mouth 
 And show me love bitch.. 

 [CHORUS] 
 [Obie Trice] 
 I just wanna love you for the rest of my life, (I dont love you bitch) 
 I wanna hold you in the morning, (Ha) 
 hold you through the night (Hahaha) 

 I just wanna love you for the rest of my life, (We wanna love alcohol, we wanna love guns,) 
 I wanna hold you in the morning, (we wanna love money) 
 hold you through the night.. (Ha) (we don't wanna love bitches though) 

 [Verse 2] 
 [Eminem] 
 There's a certain mystique when I speak, 
 that you notice that it's sorta unique, 
 cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep, 
 and I'm still matic the way I flow to this beat, 
 you can't sit still, it's like tryin to smoke crack 
 and go to sleep, I'm strapped, 
 just knowing any minute I could snap, 
 I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped, 
 I bully these rappers so bad lyrically, 
 it ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry, 
 it ain't even money, you can't pay me enough 
 for you to play me, it's cockamamie, 
 you just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady, 
 my noodle is cockadoodle, my clocks cuckoo, 
 I got screws loose, yeahhh, the whole kitten-kaboodle, 
 I'm just brutal. It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it, 
 there's no humor in it no more, you know 
 I'm rollin with a swollen bowling ball in my bag, 
 you need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass 
 you better love me bitch 

 [CHORUS] 
 I just wanna love you for the rest of my life, 
 I wanna hold you in the morning, 
 hold you through the night 

 [Obie Trice] 
 (and all the bitches say) 

 I just wanna love you for the rest of my life, 
 I wanna hold you in the morning, 
 hold you through the night 

 [Verse 3] 
 [50 Cent] 
 my buzz is crazy in the hood, they holla my name, 
 if it ain't about the flow, 
 it's about the stones and the chain, 
 if I was you, I'd love me too, 
 I roll like a bus, 9-11 pulse same color as cranberry sauce, 
 I ain't gonna front, I thought R-Kelly was tha shit, 
 then we find out he fucking round with bow wow bitch, 
 niggas eatin popcorn, right, rewinding the tape, 
 now shorty momma in the precinct hollerin rape, 
 i'm convinced man something really wrong with these hoes, 
 I thought Lil' Kim was hot then she start fucking with her nose, (God Damn) 
 used to listen to Lauren Hill and tap my feet, 
 then the bitch put out a CD that didn't have no beats, (uh-huh) 
 that boy D'Angelo he determined not to fail, 
 that nigga went butt-ass for his record to sell, 
 my back shot to help Ashanti hit them high notes, 
 and Big Ben told Charlie to deepthroat 

 [CHORUS] 
 I just wanna love you for the rest of my life, 
 I wanna hold you in the morning, (I luv'a burnish the monies, the bunnies) 
 hold you through the night(I just wanna hold you 

 I just wanna love you for the rest of my life, I wanna hold you in the morning, 
 (I just wanna love you) 
 hold you through the nightJust gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
High of a love drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer
I suffocate
And right before im about to drown she resuscitates me
She fucking hates me and I love it
Wait, where you going, I'm leaving you
No you ain't come back
We're running right back
Here we go again It's so insane
Cause when it's going good it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back
She's Lois Lane but when it's bad it's awful
I feel so ashamed, I snap, Who's that dude
I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
